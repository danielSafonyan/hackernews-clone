# hackernews-clone

Welcome to the Hacker News Clone repository!

This project is a clone of the popular social news website Hacker News and was built for educational purposes and to showcase my skills in building dynamic single-page web applications using Vanilla JavaScript. 

[The live version lives here](https://danielsafonyan.github.io/hackernews-clone/)

### Tools
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Unofficial Hacker News API** (https://node-hnapi.herokuapp.com)
- Router Navigo, a simple, dependency-free JS router (https://npmjs.com/package/navigo). 

### Users can
- View the latest, top, ask and show news stories
- Recursively view all comments for each story
- Add and remove stories from their favorites list

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I look forward to your feedback.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Best, danielSafonyan
