# hackernews-clone

Welcome to the Hacker News Clone repository!

This project is a clone of the popular social news website Hacker News and was built for educational purposes and to showcase my skills in building dynamic single-page web applications using Vanilla JavaScript. 

### Usage
To use the app, simply use the link [[https://danielsafonyan.github.io/keep-notes/](https://danielsafonyan.github.io/hackernews-clone/)] or clone the repository, start your own server [using vs code extension Live Server: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer] and open index.html. You can then start creating, editing, and managing your notes.

### Tools
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Unofficial Hacker News API** (https://node-hnapi.herokuapp.com)
- Router Navigo, a simple, dependency-free JS router (https://npmjs.com/package/navigo)
- HTML & CSS

### Features
- View the latest, top, ask and show news stories
- Recursively view all comments for each story
- Add and remove stories from their favorites list

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I look forward to your feedback.
